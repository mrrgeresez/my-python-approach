    "+ Modularity: an application is divided into smaller, independent parts.\n",
    "+ Encapsulation: elements are brought together at the same level of abstraction, allowing attributes to be hidden/protected.\n",
    "+ Inheritance: both methods and attributes can be inherited from higher classes, obtaining similar objects. Multiple inheritance exists.\n",
    "+ Polymorphism: the identification of similar behaviors in different objects.\n",

    "Attributes are characteristics, properties that are assigned to objects. Methods are the actions, functions that objects can perform. To access them, the dot notation is used. Everything is encompassed within a class, which configures the design, it is used to create instances of the same type of object.  Therefore, there are **class variables**, shared by all instances of the class (defined after the header), and there are also **instance variables** (defined within a method), belonging to a given object.\n",

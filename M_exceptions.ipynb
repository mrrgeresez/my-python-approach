    "When during the execution of a program an unexpected situation occurs, it is important to foresee what response will be provided.\n",

    "- The `except TypeError` is used to handle a specific error.\n",
    "- `else` code to be executed in case there is no error.\n",
    "- `finally` will always be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important points about the above syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single `try` statement can have **multiple** `except` statements. This is useful when the `try` block contains statements that may throw **different types of exceptions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can also provide a **generic** `except` clause **that handles any exception**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After the `except` clause(s), you can include an `else` clause. The **code** in the `else` block is executed **if** the code in the `try: block` **does not raise any exceptions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `else` block is a good place for **code that does not need the protection** of a `try: block`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `finally` block can't be placed if an `else` block is already present"

    "1. **SystemExit**: raised by the `sys.exit()` function.\n",
    "1. **StandardError**: base class for all built-in exceptions, except `StopIteration` and `SystemExit`.\n",
    "1. **ArithmeticError**: base class for all errors occurring for numerical computation.\n",
    "1. **OverflowError**: raised when a calculation exceeds the maximum limit for a numeric type.\n",
    "1. **FloatingPointError**: raised when a floating point calculation fails.\n",
    "1. **ZeroDivisionError**: raised when division or modulo by zero is performed for all numeric types.\n",
    "1. **AssertionError**: raised in case of assertion statement failure.\n",
    "1. **AttributeError**: raised in case of attribute reference or assignment failure.\n",
    "1. **EOFError**: raised when there is no input from the `raw_input()` or `input()` function and the end of file is reached.\n",
    "1. **ImportError**: raised when an import statement fails.\n",
    "1. **KeyboardInterrupt**: raised when the user interrupts the execution of the program, usually by pressing `Ctrl+c`.\n",
    "1. **LookupError**: base class for all lookup errors.\n",
    "1. **IndexError**: raised when an index is not found in a sequence.\n",
    "1. **KeyError**: raised when the specified key is not found in the dictionary.\n",
    "1. **NameError**: raised when an identifier is not found in the local or global namespace.\n",
    "1. **UnboundLocalError**: raised when an attempt is made to access a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been assigned to it.\n",
    "1. **EnvironmentError**: base class for all exceptions that occur outside the Python environment.\n",
    "1. **IOError**: raised when an input/output operation fails, such as the `print()` statement or the `open()` function when attempting to open a file that does not exist.\n",
    "1. **OSError**: raised for operating system related errors.\n",
    "1. **SyntaxError**: raised when there is a syntax error according to Python syntax.\n",
    "1. **IndentationError**: raised when indentation is not set correctly.\n",
    "1. **SystemError**: raised when the interpreter encounters an internal problem, but when this error is encountered the Python interpreter does not exit.\n",
    "1. **SystemExit**: raised when the Python interpreter is closed using the `sys.exit()` function. If not handled in the code, it causes the interpreter to exit.\n",
    "1. **TypeError**: raised when an operation or function is attempted that is invalid for the specified data type.\n",
    "1. **ValueError**: raised when the built-in function for a data type has the valid type of arguments, but the arguments have invalid values specified.\n",
    "1. **RuntimeError**: raised when a generated error does not fall into any category.\n",
    "1. **NotImplementedError**: raised when an abstract method that should be implemented in an inherited class is not actually implemented.\n",

    "An assertion is a check that you can activate or **deactivate when you are done testing** your program. The easiest way to think of an assertion is to compare it to a **raise-if** statement (or to be more precise, a **raise-if-not** statement). An expression is **tested** and **if** the result is **false, an exception** is generated. Assertions are embodied by an assertion statement. Programmers often place assertions at the beginning of a function to **check that the input is valid**, and after a function call to check that the output is valid. If the expression is **false**, Python **generates an exception** `AssertionError`."

# my-python-approach
From basic to advanced, keeping things simple. 

Any engineer or professional interested in programming will normally work with several languages, each with a peculiar syntax.

Therefore this files are not intended as a beginner's guide, but more like a quick reference for consulting.

Concepts and content is divided into begin, medium, advanced.

Some of this content is based on the python courses from OSL (UGR) https://github.com/oslugr and CEMED (UGR).

    "Given the versatility of Python, it is often used for all kinds of analysis, including statistical analysis. When you have all the data organized with libraries like pandas or numpy but you need some operation that you know is optimized in R, it is very useful to call R packages and have them return a result to continue with python. If this is not the case, you can consult the official anaconda documentation to consider other alternatives [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/).\n",

    "`rpy2` is an interface that allows us to communicate information between R and Python and to access R functionality from Python [https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v2.9.x/html/index.html].\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended approach is to create a conda environment with python version 3.5 (latest stable), and install the numeric packages of numpy and pandas along with other required packages, besides R version =>3.2 should be installed.\n",
